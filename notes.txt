theory of computation:=>automate theory(abstract machine)=>solve computation problems



appastract machine
different type of machines

computation : mathematical models=>jahn sa orginate hua ha=>  

all modes =>absactract machine=>kua ka orginal nhi ho gei mathetimaclaally ho gei

different language we learn => not related to programming lanaguge=>

that lanaguge: rules,gammer rules,mathemiatical rules apply hota ha

first level,second level=>power wise or assfiecnce wise interment to move =>final machine is turing machiane =>

then we learn how to conclude or convert into physical computer


we have multiply structure ha where we able to make transaction or simulate if input then show 


start from basic machine => we see problem =><afficense problem,space issue,we add steps=>
then we add or make strong

analyze power of model

intractability question we see
computational problem
time complexity questions

for analyansis he model

machine=>transaction diagram (tree diagram,graph,)=>google map (example)
airroute => we make graph=> every graph point => vertex

graph =>machine=>what we math behind

machine => abstract =>relate to => imaginery value,imaginery abstract => not related to physical machine
type:
finite automate(fa): no any memory:modeling base is fa
pushdown automata(pda): solve also fa problems or one step more=>one directional memory
turing machine(tm):solve all problems=>bidirectional memory (read or write both)

all prolem euqailent to tm

all machine right now equal => tm 


euailent to truning machine=>computer

then we able to check which machine lise to which machine

different components of memory

basic model =>cpu=>memory=> maiamize to processor

automaton,automata=>mean processing or programming=> tempory memory
states



tempory memory=>cpu=>input=>output=>program memory

fa: no temp memory
pushdown automata: stack memory
turning machine:

fa:(elevators,vending machine,lexical analayzers)=>no need memory
pa: stack=>push,po
parsers for proming language(medium computing power)=> we able to hold
tm: random access memory(read,write both)

fa:lower power
tm:more power
turning machine is mostpoiwerful machineknow as computational model
not solve all problems

solveable,decideable,recogniazable=> that lanaguge =>is decide not recogniazable,any lanigae => that decideable but not solveable


tm : ma research ka area open ha (np)
p=>polynomial problem=>fast as compared to np

np(not deterministic polynomials=>believed to take expotential time to be solved

language : set of stroing
string: sequsnce of symbols from alphabets

string: 
language:
alphabet:basic element of any language (every language) we define by submission=> define basic elements where our language or models make=>all symbols =>all percentage=> all enter=> all letter=>$ => all symbols => set of eleements

alphabets join or make string=>

one elements is a sequenece of symbols =>that make language

language =>all the possible  set of string=>used to describe of computation problems=>with set

string=>  sequesnce of symbols =>without set =>make a seuqnce of symbols from alphabets

codnition may be : start with a,aa


string: cat,dog,house
lang: {cat,dog,house}
alphabet:{a,b,c,...,z}

computation is translate to set membership.

when make any machine(string)=>111=> equal to 3
unary => number equalt to 1 => when add one=> 1+1=>11(2)=>only symbolics equalent

string operation

contactenation(join)=>side  by side write same =->make new string=>one after then other
order important is very 

reverse => reverse order(last will be first or first will be last )

string length : count of alphabelst ,.number of alphabaets

empty string : no letter ,no alphanets=>represtend by lambda=>length must be zero

when we use contenation => then reult must be same

substring:
subsequence of consectutive character
